# JoshHub Improvements Tracker

Central log for the 30 reviewed apps/games, aligned to the QA summary (6 gold, 15 functional-but-unpolished, 9 critical). Use this as the single place to note fixes and canonical versions.

## Snapshot
- Gold standard: Campaign Copilot, Whispering Wilds, DCS Prep, Mysterious Depths, Starhaven (+1 slot for the next fully polished app).
- Fix-first: Boundary Road Panos, Tile Game, DCS Companion (no demo), NFC Audio Player (no desktop fallback), OrgScape (raw text).
- Global sweeps: add Back to Hub + Instructions UI everywhere, document controls, and hide duplicate variants (keep one canonical link per app).

## Gold Standard (reference quality)
- Campaign Copilot — production-ready D&D tool.
- Whispering Wilds — polished interactive fiction with map/inventory.
- DCS Prep — clean modern educational portal.
- Mysterious Depths — atmospheric text adventure.
- Starhaven — stylish murder mystery with great typography.
- Next-in-line slot — promote the next app once it meets the same bar.

## Fix-First Tickets
- Boundary Road Panos — black screen/missing assets. Action: ship bundled panos or placeholders and add clear controls + back link.
- Tile Game — blank page (missing canvas bundle). Action: fix asset paths, add header + control hints.
- DCS Companion — locked behind login. Action: ship a demo mode or local walkthrough page plus keep the live link.
- Josh NFC Audio — desktop fallback missing. Action: add “no NFC” message + sample audio playback.
- OrgScape (Infinite Office) — raw text shell. Action: add minimal UI framing + instructions/back to hub.

## Global Sweeps
- Navigation: inject a standard “JoshHub Header” (Home link + Instructions toggle) into every local app wrapper.
- Instructions: ensure each game has a short controls/goals blurb and that it is reachable from the header toggle.
- Duplicates: hide variant links; keep one canonical version (itch vs GH vs local) per title.
- Version notes: keep secondary versions in the link list, not as separate tiles.

# JoshHub – Portfolio Improvement Master Document (All 30 Apps)

## Purpose of this document

This document exists to move JoshHub from:

> **“collection of impressive prototypes” → “cohesive, portfolio-ready platform”**

It focuses on:

* Highest ROI improvements
* Practical developer tasks
* What to fix first, second, and never touch (yet)

---

## PART 1 — Combined App Improvement Index (All 30)

Below is a **merged, deduplicated view** of all apps with **one “big lever” improvement each**, incorporating **your suggestions + QA findings**.

### Games / Interactive

1. **AAGameAdventure**
   → Procedural map generation (seed-based, plugin driven)
   *(High impact, high effort, excellent long-term payoff)*

2. **AModuleDnd**
   → Skill tree + ability system tied to leveling
   *(High impact, medium effort)*

3. **Whispering Wilds (all versions)**
   → Shared world / seed sharing / light multiplayer artifacts
   *(Very high impact, high effort)*
   **Short-term alt:** unify versions + onboarding polish

4. **AAA – D&D RPG Dungeon Game**
   → Save/load with multiple slots
   *(Extremely high ROI, medium effort)*

5. **Mysterious Depths**
   → Branching narrative + multiple endings
   *(High narrative ROI, medium effort)*

6. **Tile Game (A)**
   → Enemy AI + combat loop
   *(Medium impact, low–medium effort)*

7. **LetsPlayDnD**
   → Persistent characters (localStorage saves)
   *(Very high ROI, low effort)*

8. **NewGame / Dark Realms**
   → Modular refactor of monolithic JS
   *(Foundation work, high effort, unblocker for everything else)*

9. **Null / Null v2**
   → Sound-based danger & stealth system
   *(Medium–high impact, medium effort)*

10. **Infinite Office / Orgscape**
    → Procedural event generator
    *(Medium impact, medium effort)*

11. **SimpleRPG (all variants)**
    → Consolidate into ONE polished version
    *(Medium impact, medium effort)*

12. **Lexicon**
    → Source release OR modding tools
    *(Strategic decision, high effort or non-code)*

13. **Neon Dash**
    → Either finish core loop or formally archive
    *(Clarity win, low effort)*

---

### Tools / Apps

14. **Boundary Road Panos**
    → Fix missing pano assets + loading fallback
    *(Very easy, very high polish ROI)*

15. **NFC Audio Player**
    → Empty-state onboarding + browser capability warnings
    *(Easy, high usability ROI)*

16. **Josh & Kristy Budget Keeper**
    → Demo walkthrough + seeded example data
    *(Easy, huge clarity win)*

17. **Campaign Copilot**
    → First-run “How to use this in a real D&D session” flow
    *(Easy, high perceived value)*

18. **DCS Companion**
    → Layout fix (left column width + responsiveness)
    *(Easy, professional polish)*

19. **DCS Prep App**
    → Progress persistence + completion feedback
    *(Medium effort, strong usefulness boost)*

20–30. **Other prototypes / v2s / experiments**
→ Consistency pass: headers, back-to-hub links, help text
*(Easy batch wins)*

---

## PART 2 — Easiest → Hardest Improvements (Across All 30)

### 🟢 **Low-Hanging Fruit (Do These First)**

*(30–90 mins each, massive perceived quality jump)*

1. Add **“Back to JoshHub”** link to every app
2. Add **1-screen onboarding text** (“What is this? What do I do first?”)
3. Fix **broken assets / black screens** (Boundary Panos)
4. Add **empty states** (NFC Player, Budget App, Campaign Copilot)
5. Standardize **header + container width + spacing**
6. Add **Help / Controls panel** to all games
7. Archive or label **unfinished/abandoned** projects clearly
8. Fix contrast / font sizing issues
9. Add **reset / restart** buttons
10. Add **localStorage save** where trivial

➡️ **These alone will make JoshHub feel 2× more “finished.”**

---

### 🟡 **Medium Effort, High Impact**

* Save/load systems (AAA, LetsPlayDnD)
* Enemy AI (Tile Game)
* Procedural events (Orgscape)
* Branching narrative (Mysterious Depths)
* Skill systems (AModuleDnd)
* Version unification (Whispering Wilds)

---

### 🔴 **Hard / Long-Term Bets**

* Multiplayer / shared world (Whispering Wilds)
* Procedural dungeon generation (AAGameAdventure)
* Major refactors (Dark Realms)
* Modding ecosystems (Lexicon)

---

## PART 3 — Portfolio-Wide Patterns (What to Fix Once, Everywhere)

### Recurring issues

* No clear **“what is this?”**
* No consistent navigation
* No save/persistence
* Multiple versions of same idea
* Silent failure states
* Inconsistent layout widths

### Platform-level fixes (huge leverage)

1. **JoshHub App Shell**

   * Header (Title + Back + Reset)
   * Instructions panel
   * Consistent container width
2. **Link audit in CI** (you already started this 👍)
3. **Standard folder contract**

   ```
   /public/games/<slug>/index.html
   /public/docs/<slug>.html
   ```
4. **README micro-template**

   * What is this?
   * How to play/use
   * What’s unfinished

---

## PART 4 — “If You Only Have 2 Hours” Plan

**Hour 1**

* Add Back-to-Hub links everywhere
* Fix Boundary Road Panos black screen
* Add onboarding text to 3 flagship apps

**Hour 2**

* Add localStorage save to LetsPlayDnD
* Add empty states to NFC Player & Budget App
* Archive Neon Dash with README

---

## PART 5 — Codex Prompt (VS Code on WSL)

Copy-paste **exactly this** into Codex:

---

### 🔧 CODEx TASK PROMPT — JoshHub Quick Wins Sprint

> You are an expert frontend engineer working in a monorepo deployed to Vercel.
> Your goal is to apply **high-ROI polish and stability improvements** across multiple small web apps listed on JoshHub.

#### Objectives (in order)

1. Add a consistent **App Header** to every app:

   * Title
   * “Back to JoshHub” link
   * Optional Reset button
2. Add a **1-screen onboarding panel** to each app explaining:

   * What this app/game is
   * What to do first
3. Fix **broken assets / black screens**, especially:

   * Boundary Road Panos
4. Add **empty states** where data is missing:

   * NFC Audio Player
   * Budget Keeper
   * Campaign Copilot
5. Where trivial, add **localStorage save/load**:

   * LetsPlayDnD
   * Text-based games

#### Constraints

* Do NOT refactor architecture
* Prefer static HTML/CSS/JS changes
* Keep changes small, testable, reversible

#### Acceptance Criteria

* Every app has a visible way back to JoshHub
* No app loads to a blank or confusing screen
* First-time users understand what to do in <10 seconds
* No new console errors introduced

#### Deliverables

* Small commits per app
* Clear commit messages
* No breaking changes

---

## Final Note (Important)

Josh — this portfolio is **already strong**.
The problem is **not lack of ideas or depth**. It’s **clarity and finish**.

If you do:

* The **low-hanging fruit**
* Then **2–3 medium improvements**
* And clearly **archive the rest**

JoshHub becomes:

> **“This person ships systems, not just experiments.”**

If you want, next we can:

* Pick **Top 5 flagship apps**
* Turn them into **case-study-grade portfolio pieces**
* Or build a **JoshHub v2 narrative** (“why these exist together”)

Just say the word.
